# predict-the-electrical-energy-output-of-a-Combined-Cycle-Power-Plant
ANN model is used for Supervised Learning and previously we have applied ANN model in classification in the case of "Churn Modeling" (one of my previous project) but now we will apply this ANN model for predicting continuous value, i.e ANN with Regression.
 Here, we have a dataset having columns(corresponding to power plant) :
Atmospheric Temperature
Vaccum
Atmospheric Pressure
Relative Humidity
We will be predicting Electrical Energy Output using ANN. When our model is trained on 30 epoch, we get a loss of 34% on test set and that's an satisfying result.
